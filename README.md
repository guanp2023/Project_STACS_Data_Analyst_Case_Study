Project (From Real Company) - STACS Data Analyst Case Study

ESGpedia regularly collects datasets from various data registries and data partners. For this case study, you will be tasked to collect and analyze data from a data registry called NABERS.

NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating System) is a sustainable rating for buildings in Australia. A NABERS rating helps building owners to accurately measure and communicate the environmental performance and progress of buildings. It also identifies areas for savings and improvements.

The data is publicly available here: https://www.nabers.gov.au/ratings/find-a-current-rating.

Requirements: 
- Explain and show how you would automate the collection of the data from the website.
- Carry out any data cleaning and data processing steps where necessary. 
- Present the data in an interactive dashboard to capture any insights you would like to highlight or point out. 
- Languages to use: Python/SQL.

Some guiding questions have been provided below to assist you in your analysis. Please note that these questions are not exhaustive and you are highly encouraged to generate additional questions that you believe will be relevant to the task.

- How often should the data be collected?
- What is the distribution of green buildings in Australia? 
- How many certificates are expiring soon? 
- What is the average rating value of each building?
